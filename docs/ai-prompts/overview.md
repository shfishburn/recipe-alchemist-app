# AI Prompts and Responses Overview

This overview document provides a guide to all AI prompt systems and response formats used throughout the Recipe Alchemy application. The documentation has been organized into separate files by functional area for easier navigation and maintenance.

## Documentation Structure

The AI prompts and responses documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. [Recipe Generation Prompts](./recipe-generation.md) - Prompts for creating new recipes
2. [Recipe Modification Prompts](./recipe-modification.md) - Systems for modifying existing recipes
3. [Recipe Chat Prompts](./recipe-chat.md) - Conversational AI prompts and response formats
4. [Nutrition Analysis Prompts](./nutrition-analysis.md) - Prompts related to nutrition calculations
5. [Science Notes Generation](./science-notes.md) - Prompts for generating scientific content
6. [Integration Between Systems](./integration.md) - How the various AI systems interconnect

## Purpose

These documents provide technical details about:

- Prompt engineering approaches
- Response format requirements
- Data flow between systems
- Error handling mechanisms
- Integration points between AI components

This documentation is primarily intended for developers working on the Recipe Alchemy codebase who need to understand how the AI components function and interact with each other.

## Key Concepts

Throughout these documents, you'll encounter these common concepts:

- **Prompt Structure**: How prompts are engineered to produce consistent, high-quality outputs
- **Response Format**: The expected JSON or text structure returned by AI models
- **Data Flow**: How data moves between components in the system
- **López-Alt Style**: Scientific cooking style inspired by J. Kenji López-Alt
- **USDA Data Integration**: How recipe data connects to standardized nutrition databases
