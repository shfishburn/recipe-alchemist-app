# Security Architecture

This document outlines the security architecture of the Recipe Alchemy platform, detailing how we protect user data, ensure secure access, and maintain system integrity.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

Recipe Alchemy uses Supabase Auth for authentication with these security measures:

1. **Email & Password Authentication**
   - Passwords stored with bcrypt hashing
   - Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - Email verification required
   
2. **JWT-Based Session Management**
   - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
   - Longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
   - Secure, HTTP-only cookies for token storage
   
3. **Session Management**
   - Users can view active sessions
   - Force logout from any or all devices
   - Automatic session termination after inactivity

### Authorization Model

Access control follows these principles:

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**
   - Database policies restrict access to owned data
   - Public/private recipe visibility controls
   - Fine-grained permission system for shared resources

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Standard users - Basic recipe creation and modification
   - Premium users - Additional features and higher usage limits
   - Administrators - System management capabilities
   - Content moderators - Review and moderate public content

## Data Protection

### Data at Rest

Data stored in the system is protected by:

1. **Encryption**
   - Database encryption for sensitive data
   - Transparent data encryption for storage
   - Key management via Supabase Vault

2. **Data Isolation**
   - Multi-tenant architecture with strong isolation
   - Logical separation of customer data
   - Regular data access audits

### Data in Transit

Communication is secured through:

1. **Transport Layer Security**
   - TLS 1.3 for all HTTP communications
   - Certificate rotation and management
   - HTTPS enforcement and HSTS headers

2. **API Security**
   - Request signing for sensitive operations
   - API keys stored securely
   - Regular API access audits

### Personal Data Handling

User privacy is ensured through:

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Only essential personal data is collected
   - Anonymous usage analytics where possible
   - Regular data purging of unnecessary information

2. **User Controls**
   - Data export functionality
   - Account deletion option
   - Preference and privacy controls

## AI Content Security

### Input Validation

To prevent prompt injection and other AI-specific threats:

1. **Input Sanitization**
   - All user inputs sanitized before inclusion in prompts
   - Structured prompts resistant to injection
   - Parameter validation and normalization

2. **Content Filtering**
   - Detection of inappropriate content requests
   - Automatic rejection of problematic inputs
   - Human review for edge cases

### Output Safety

Generated content is secured through:

1. **Content Moderation**
   - AI-generated content scanned for safety
   - Filtering of harmful instructions
   - Scientific accuracy validation

2. **Versioning and Auditing**
   - All generated content is versioned
   - Audit trail of content creation
   - Ability to revert problematic content

## Infrastructure Security

### Cloud Security Posture

The infrastructure employs these security measures:

1. **Environment Isolation**
   - Separate development, staging, and production environments
   - Network segmentation between components
   - Least privilege access principles

2. **Vulnerability Management**
   - Regular security scanning
   - Automated dependency updates
   - Penetration testing schedule

### Monitoring and Incident Response

Security events are managed through:

1. **Detection Systems**
   - Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
   - Monitoring for suspicious API usage
   - Real-time alerting for security events

2. **Incident Response**
   - Documented response procedures
   - Regular tabletop exercises
   - Post-incident reviews and improvements

## Compliance Considerations

Recipe Alchemy addresses these compliance areas:

1. **GDPR Compliance**
   - Data subject access rights
   - Right to be forgotten implementation
   - Data processing agreements

2. **CCPA/CPRA Compliance**
   - California privacy rights support
   - Do Not Sell My Information controls
   - Data retention policies
