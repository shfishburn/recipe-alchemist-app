# Contribution Guide

This guide outlines the process for contributing to the Recipe Alchemy project, including code contributions, documentation improvements, and reporting issues.

## Code Contribution Process

### Getting Started

1. **Pick an Issue**: Start with issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted"
2. **Claim the Issue**: Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
3. **Discuss Approach**: For larger features, discuss implementation approach first

### Development Process

1. **Create a Branch**: Branch naming conventions:
   - Features: `feature/short-description`
   - Bugs: `fix/issue-description`
   - Documentation: `docs/topic-name`
   - Refactoring: `refactor/component-name`

2. **Develop and Test**: Implement your changes with appropriate tests

3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure documentation is updated to reflect changes

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Include:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Link to related issue(s)
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Any notes on testing or potential impacts

### Code Review Process

All code contributions go through review:

1. **Initial Review**: Automated checks for linting, tests, and types
2. **Peer Review**: At least one approval required from maintainers
3. **Feedback Cycle**: Address review comments and update
4. **Final Approval**: Maintainer approves and merges

## Coding Standards

### General Principles

- **Readability**: Code should be easy to understand
- **Maintainability**: Design for future developers
- **Performance**: Consider impact on application performance
- **Accessibility**: Ensure features are accessible

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use proper type annotations instead of `any`
- Create interfaces for component props and state
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types when appropriate

### Component Guidelines

- Create small, focused components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- Design components for reusability

### Style Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the design system patterns
- Ensure responsive design across devices
- Use semantic HTML elements

### Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Update tests when modifying existing code
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Aim for good test coverage

## Documentation Contributions

### Documentation Standards

Recipe Alchemy documentation follows these standards:

- Clear, concise language
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 -> h2 -> h3)
- Code examples where relevant
- Cross-references to related documents

### Documentation Updates

To update documentation:

1. Make changes to markdown files in the `docs` directory
2. Follow the existing folder structure
3. Use relative links for cross-references
4. Include diagrams where helpful (using Mermaid syntax)

### Documentation Review

Documentation changes undergo review for:
- Technical accuracy
- Clarity and readability
- Consistency with existing docs
- Proper cross-referencing

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

- **Unit Tests**: For individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: For feature flows
- **Accessibility Tests**: For UI components
- **Performance Tests**: For resource-intensive operations

### Test Coverage

Aim for adequate test coverage:
- All new code should have associated tests
- Critical paths should have comprehensive coverage
- Edge cases should be considered

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, include:

1. Clear summary of the issue
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Expected vs. actual behavior
4. Environment details (browser, OS, app version)
5. Screenshots or video if applicable
6. Console errors or logs

### Feature Requests

For feature suggestions, provide:

1. Clear description of the feature
2. Rationale and use cases
3. Potential implementation approaches
4. Mock-ups or examples (if possible)
