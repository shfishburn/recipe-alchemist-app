# Versioning Strategy

This document outlines the versioning approach for Recipe Alchemy's data, models, and features to ensure consistency and backward compatibility.

## Data Source Versioning

### USDA Database Updates

Recipe Alchemy relies on the USDA Food Database for nutritional information. Updates are managed as follows:

1. **Versioned Database Imports**
   - Each USDA database import is tagged with a version identifier
   - Nutritional calculations reference the specific version used
   - Recipes maintain reference to the database version used for calculations

2. **Migration Process**
   - New USDA data is imported to a staging database
   - Validation tests confirm data quality
   - Mapping table updated to connect ingredients to new food IDs
   - Gradual migration of calculations to new database version

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Previous database versions remain available for historical recipes
   - Version reconciliation service translates between versions when needed
   - Nutrition confidence scoring adjusted based on version differences

## AI Model Versioning

### Model Management

OpenAI model updates are handled through:

1. **Model Version Testing**
   - New AI models tested against benchmark recipe set
   - A/B testing for quality comparison
   - Performance and cost metrics recorded

2. **Controlled Rollouts**
   - Models released to internal users first
   - Staged release to percentage of production traffic
   - Automatic rollback if quality metrics decline

3. **Model Version References**
   - Generated content contains metadata about model version
   - Recipes can be regenerated with newer models upon request
   - Recipe quality metrics tracked by model version

### Prompt Versioning

AI prompts are versioned using:

1. **Prompt Repository**
   - All prompts stored in version-controlled repository
   - Historical prompt versions preserved
   - A/B testing framework for prompt improvements

2. **Prompt Deployment Pipeline**
   - Automated testing before prompt deployment
   - Canary deployments for new prompts
   - Automatic quality monitoring after deployment

## Recipe Content Versioning

### Recipe Evolution

Recipes in the system evolve through:

1. **Version History**
   - Complete version history maintained for all recipes
   - Each modification creates new version
   - Users can access previous versions of their recipes

2. **Modification Tracking**
   - Changes between versions clearly identified
   - Modification reasons recorded
   - Nutrition changes highlighted between versions

3. **Content Migration**
   - Strategy for updating recipes when major system changes occur
   - Batch processing for system-wide updates
   - User notification system for significant recipe changes

## Feature Flagging System

New capabilities are managed through:

1. **Feature Flag Management**
   - Centralized feature flag configuration
   - User cohort targeting for gradual rollouts
   - A/B testing framework integrated with flags

2. **Feature Lifecycle**
   - Alpha features (internal only)
   - Beta features (limited user access)
   - General availability (all users)
   - Deprecation process for retiring features

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Core functionality works without new features
   - Enhanced experience with new capabilities
   - Graceful degradation when features unavailable

## API Versioning

API evolution is managed through:

1. **URI-Based Versioning**
   - Major versions in URI path (`/api/v1/recipes`)
   - Breaking changes trigger major version increment
   - Multiple API versions supported concurrently

2. **Deprecation Process**
   - APIs deprecated before removal
   - Minimum 6-month deprecation period
   - Usage monitoring to identify affected clients

3. **API Evolution**
   - Non-breaking additions without version change
   - Backward compatible changes preferred
   - Version migration guides provided

## Database Schema Versioning

Database changes follow:

1. **Migration Scripts**
   - Numbered, sequential migrations
   - Both up and down migrations supported
   - Transactions for atomic updates

2. **Schema Versioning**
   - Database schema version tracked in metadata table
   - Application checks compatibility at startup
   - Automatic migration for minor version changes
