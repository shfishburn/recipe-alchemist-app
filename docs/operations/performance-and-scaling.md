# Performance and Scaling

This document outlines the performance optimization and scaling strategies implemented in the Recipe Alchemy platform.

## Caching Strategy

Recipe Alchemy employs a multi-level caching approach:

### 1. Client-Side Caching

- **React Query Cache**
  - TTL-based caching for API responses
  - Deduplication of in-flight requests
  - Optimistic updates for responsive UI
  - Background revalidation patterns

- **Local Storage Cache**
  - Recently viewed recipes
  - User preferences
  - Draft content
  - Offline capability for essential functions

### 2. API-Level Caching

- **Edge Caching**
  - CDN caching for static assets
  - Cache-Control headers optimized per resource type
  - Edge function response caching where appropriate

- **Server-Side Cache**
  - Redis cache for frequently accessed data
  - Recipe search results caching
  - User permission caching
  - Generated content with appropriate invalidation

### 3. Database Caching

- **Query Result Caching**
  - Materialized views for complex aggregations
  - Connection pooling for optimal resource utilization
  - Prepared statement caching

## Performance Benchmarks

Key performance metrics are regularly measured:

### 1. Recipe Generation Performance

| Operation               | Target Time | P95 Time | Optimization Status |
|-------------------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| Quick Recipe Generation | < 15s       | 18s      | In optimization     |
| Detailed Recipe         | < 25s       | 23s      | Meeting target      |
| Recipe Modification     | < 10s       | 12s      | In optimization     |
| Chat Response           | < 3s        | 2.8s     | Meeting target      |

### 2. Front-End Performance

| Metric                   | Target     | Current   | Status            |
|--------------------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| First Contentful Paint   | < 1.5s     | 1.2s      | Meeting target    |
| Time to Interactive      | < 3.0s     | 3.1s      | Near target       |
| Largest Contentful Paint | < 2.5s     | 2.3s      | Meeting target    |
| Cumulative Layout Shift  | < 0.1      | 0.05      | Meeting target    |
| Bundle Size (main)       | < 150KB    | 145KB     | Meeting target    |

## Scaling Approach

The system scales through these strategies:

### 1. Horizontal Scaling

- **Stateless Services**
  - All API services designed for horizontal scaling
  - No instance-specific state
  - Connection pooling for backend resources

- **Database Scaling**
  - Read replicas for scaling read operations
  - Connection pooling
  - Query optimization and indexing strategy

### 2. Workload Optimization

- **Asynchronous Processing**
  - Background processing for intensive operations
  - Job queuing for peak load management
  - Webhook-based task distribution

- **Concurrent Request Handling**
  - Batch processing capability
  - Request prioritization for critical paths
  - Graceful degradation under heavy load

### 3. Resource Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**
  - Components and data loaded only when needed
  - Image lazy loading and optimization
  - Code splitting for optimized bundle sizes

- **Incremental Processing**
  - Progressive enhancement of recipe data
  - Initial fast response with continued enhancement
  - Nutrition calculation performed incrementally

## Load Testing Methodology

The system is regularly load tested with:

### 1. Test Profiles

- **Normal Load**
  - Simulated typical user behavior
  - Expected daily peak traffic patterns
  - Standard mix of operations

- **Spike Testing**
  - Sudden increase to 5x normal traffic
  - Flash traffic patterns (e.g., after media mention)
  - Recovery time measurement

- **Endurance Testing**
  - Sustained elevated traffic (2x normal)
  - 24-hour continuous operation tests
  - Resource leak detection

### 2. Performance Test Automation

- Automated tests run on staging environment
- Pre-release performance validation
- Regression testing for performance metrics
- Alert triggers if performance degrades

## API Rate Limiting

To protect system resources and ensure fair usage:

### 1. OpenAI Integration

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Per-user limits for AI-intensive operations
  - Token budgeting based on user tier
  - Queuing system for managing rate limits
  - Exponential backoff for retries

- **Cost Optimization**
  - Model selection based on complexity needs
  - Prompt optimization for token efficiency
  - Caching of identical requests
  - Batch processing where applicable

### 2. User-Facing API Limits

| User Tier      | Recipes/Day | Modifications/Day | Chat Messages/Day |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Free           | 5           | 10                | 20                |
| Standard       | 20          | 50                | 100               |
| Premium        | 50          | 200               | Unlimited         |
| Enterprise     | Custom      | Custom            | Custom            |

## Resource Optimization

Additional optimization strategies include:

### 1. Image Optimization

- Responsive image sizing
- WebP format with fallbacks
- Progressive loading
- Content-aware compression

### 2. Scientific Content Optimization

- Precomputed common scientific explanations
- Scientific content shared across similar recipes
- Progressive enhancement of scientific detail
