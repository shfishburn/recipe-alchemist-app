# Recipe Detail System

This document details the Recipe Detail system, which displays comprehensive information about recipes and provides interactive features for users.

## System Overview

The Recipe Detail system presents recipes with:
- Complete ingredient lists with measurements
- Step-by-step instructions
- Nutritional information
- Scientific explanations
- Interactive cooking mode
- Shopping list integration
- Recipe modification capabilities

## Key Components

### 1. Recipe Detail Content

The main container component (`RecipeDetailContent.tsx`) organizes:
- Recipe header with title and metadata
- Recipe image
- Action buttons for saving, sharing, etc.
- Tab navigation for different views

### 2. Navigation Tabs

The system uses a tab-based interface to organize content:

1. **Recipe Tab**: Main recipe content with ingredients and instructions
2. **Nutrition Tab**: Detailed nutritional information and analysis
3. **Science Tab**: Scientific explanations of cooking methods
4. **Modify Tab**: Interface for AI-powered recipe modifications
5. **Utilities Tab**: Additional tools like shopping list conversion

### 3. Cooking Mode

Interactive cooking experience with:
- Step-by-step guidance
- Built-in timers
- Ingredient reference
- Progress tracking

## Data Flow

### 1. Recipe Data Fetching

The system fetches recipe data using the `useRecipeDetail` hook:
```typescript
const { data: recipe, isLoading, error } = useRecipeDetail(idOrSlug);
```

This hook:
- Accepts UUID or slug identifiers
- Returns detailed recipe data
- Handles loading and error states
- Normalizes nutrition data

### 2. Recipe Display

The fetched data is processed and displayed through specialized components:
- `RecipeHeader` for title and metadata
- `RecipeIngredients` for ingredient list
- `RecipeInstructions` for cooking steps
- `RecipeNutrition` for nutritional information

### 3. Interactive Features

User interactions trigger various functions:
- Toggle cooking mode
- Share recipe
- Print recipe
- Add to shopping list
- Chat with AI about the recipe

## Nutrition Analysis System

A key subsystem for detailed nutritional analysis:

### 1. Components

- `NutritionChart`: Visual representation of macronutrients
- `NutritionSummary`: Text summary of nutritional values
- `MacroBreakdown`: Detailed breakdown of macronutrients
- `MicronutrientsDisplay`: Information about vitamins and minerals
- `NutriScoreBadge`: Indicates overall nutritional quality

### 2. Data Processing

The system processes nutrition data through:
- Standardization of units
- Calculation of daily values
- Comparison to dietary recommendations
- Visualization preparation

## Science Explanation System

Provides scientific context for cooking methods:

### 1. Components

- `ScienceNotes`: Displays scientific insights about the recipe
- `StepReactionItem`: Shows chemical reactions for specific steps

### 2. Integration with Recipe Analysis

- Links specific cooking techniques to scientific explanations
- Visualizes temperature effects on ingredients
- Explains flavor development processes

## Recipe Modification Integration

The detail view integrates with the modification system through:
- Recipe chat interface
- Apply changes workflow
- Modification history tracking

## Shopping List Integration

Allows direct conversion to shopping lists:
- "Add to Shopping List" functionality
- Options for existing lists or new list
- Package size awareness

## Performance Optimizations

The system implements several optimizations:

1. **Query Caching**:
   - Uses React Query for efficient data fetching
   - Implements stale-while-revalidate pattern
   - Configures appropriate cache times

2. **Code Splitting**:
   - Lazy loads tab content
   - Defers loading of complex visualization components

3. **Image Optimization**:
   - Implements responsive images
   - Uses appropriate image formats
   - Provides loading placeholders

## Error Handling

The system has robust error handling:
- Fallback UI for missing recipe data
- Clear error messages for failed fetches
- Graceful degradation for missing nutrition data

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the Recipe Detail system:

1. **Enhanced Interactivity**:
   - Interactive 3D models of cooking processes
   - Step-based videos for complex techniques

2. **Personalized Nutrition**:
   - Adjust nutrition display based on user profiles
   - Show personalized daily value percentages

3. **Improved Accessibility**:
   - Audio descriptions of cooking steps
   - High-contrast mode for visually impaired users
