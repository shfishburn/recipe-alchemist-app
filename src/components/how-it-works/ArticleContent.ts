    How Nutrition Analysis Works
    We don't guess what's in your food — we measure it with real science. Our system pulls data from trusted sources like USDA FoodData Central, adjusts for cooking methods, tracks both macronutrients and vital micronutrients, and personalizes your nutrition to your body's needs. Every recipe you see reflects not just what you cook — but how it truly nourishes you.
    
    Food is Not Static: Why Accurate Nutrition Analysis Matters
    When you cook a steak, it loses water and shrinks.
    When you steam broccoli, some vitamins leach into the cooking water.
    When you eat fat with carrots, your body absorbs more vitamin A.
    
    These are the realities of food — constantly changing, interacting, transforming. But most nutrition apps don't account for any of this. They treat food like numbers in a database, not living chemistry that shifts with every cooking technique and combination.
    
    We believe you deserve better information about what you're really eating.
    
    That's why our nutrition analysis accounts for the real science of food:
    
    1. We Start with Quality Data
    Our system doesn't guess — it measures. We pull nutrition data from:
    
    USDA FoodData Central — laboratory-analyzed data, the gold standard in nutrition science
    Academic food composition databases — for unique or specialty ingredients
    Branded food databases — for packaged products
    
    This means you're seeing real numbers, not estimates.
    
    2. We Account for Cooking Methods
    Different cooking techniques transform food in different ways:
    
    Boiling can reduce water-soluble vitamins by up to 50%
    Grilling changes fat content as drippings are lost
    Baking causes moisture loss, concentrating some nutrients
    
    Our system applies scientifically validated retention factors to adjust nutrition values based on your cooking method.
    
    3. We Track the Full Nutrition Picture
    While most apps focus only on calories and macronutrients, we believe the micronutrients are equally important:
    
    Essential minerals like iron, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc
    Full vitamin profile including folate, riboflavin, and vitamins A, C, D, E, K
    Amino acid profiles for protein quality tracking
    
    Because health is about more than just calories in, calories out.
    
    4. We Balance Scientific Depth with Practical Clarity
    While our engine runs on complex calculations, what you see is clear and actionable:
    
    Visual representations of nutrient density
    Percentage of daily needs met (personalized to your body)
    Plain-language explanations of nutrition highlights
    
    So you always understand not just what you're eating, but why it matters.
    
    5. We Design for Bioavailability, Not Just Content
    It's not just what nutrients are in your food — it's whether your body can use them:
    
    We pair vitamin C with iron-rich foods to enhance absorption
    We include healthy fats with fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K
    We combine complementary plant proteins for complete amino acid profiles
    
    These pairings aren't random — they're designed to maximize how your body uses what you eat.
    
    Why Precision Nutrition Matters for Your Real Life
    When you understand what's truly in your food, cooking becomes more than just feeding yourself — it becomes a powerful tool for supporting your health goals, athletic performance, energy levels, and long-term vitality.
    
    With accurate nutrition analysis, you can:
    
    Make confident substitutions knowing the real impact
    Balance your plate more effectively
    Identify and address potential nutrient gaps
    Connect what you eat with how you feel
    
    You deserve to know what you're really eating — not just what you're cooking.
    That's the difference with Recipe Alchemist.

    How Our AI Crafts Smarter Recipes
    Our AI builds recipes with real food science — using trusted nutrition data, cooking chemistry, and precision techniques to create meals that are not just delicious, but deeply nourishing. Real science. Real flavor. Real life.
    
    Recipe generation isn't just about listing ingredients and steps. Our AI uses data science and food science to create meals that are nutritionally optimized and scientifically sound.
    
    We draw from extensive databases of ingredients, cooking methods, and nutritional information to generate recipes that meet your specific dietary needs.
    
    The AI also considers flavor profiles, texture combinations, and cooking chemistry to ensure that each recipe is not just nutritious but delicious.
    
    This approach to recipe creation represents a significant advancement over traditional recipe databases or simple AI-generated content.

    How We Align Every Recipe to Your Health Goals
    Your body is unique — and your food should be too. We start by understanding your energy needs and nutrition goals, from daily calorie targets to protein, carb, and fat ratios. Every recipe we build then adapts to you, balancing macronutrients and key vitamins and minerals, while weaving in smart ingredient choices that boost nutrient absorption naturally.
    
    We recognize that optimal nutrition varies widely from person to person based on factors like age, weight, activity level, health goals, and dietary preferences.
    
    Our system first establishes your baseline nutritional requirements, calculating calorie needs based on your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).
    
    From there, we determine appropriate macronutrient distributions and micronutrient targets tailored to your specific profile.
    
    When generating recipes, our AI automatically adjusts ingredient quantities and selections to align with these personalized nutritional parameters.
    
    This personalization extends beyond macronutrients to include appropriate micronutrient levels, ingredient compatibility with dietary restrictions, and even consideration of nutrient timing relative to your daily schedule.

  'substitutions': `
    Smart Ingredient Substitutions
    Great cooking isn't rigid — it's flexible, creative, and alive. With our AI assistant, you can customize recipes in real time, making smart ingredient swaps that preserve flavor, structure, and nutrition. Whether you're cooking dairy-free, swapping to whole grains, or adjusting for allergies, our system guides you with real food science — so your meals stay joyful, nourishing, and entirely yours.
    
    Our substitution system analyzes ingredients along multiple dimensions: flavor profile, texture, cooking behavior, nutritional content, and functional role in a recipe.
    
    When you request a substitution, the AI identifies alternatives that match as closely as possible across these dimensions, ensuring the integrity of the dish remains intact.
    
    For example, if you need to replace butter in a recipe, the system recognizes whether the butter is primarily providing fat, moisture, flavor, or structure, and suggests appropriate alternatives accordingly (which might be different for a cake versus a pan-searing application).
    
    This intelligent substitution capability extends to handling dietary restrictions, ingredient availability issues, and even nutritional optimizations.
    
    All substitution suggestions come with explanatory notes about how they might affect the final dish and any adjustments to cooking techniques that might be beneficial.
